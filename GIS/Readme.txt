This function extract data from raster layer (tiff). You need to have UTM points (csv file) to extract data. If you want edit column name after extraction you can add rename = “Yes” to the function but you need to edit line 37-39 in function according your raster layer. 
I provided test folder that contains raster layers in tiff and points as csv file.
